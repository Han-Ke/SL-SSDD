SL-SSDD: Sea-Land Segmentation Dataset for SSDD

SL-SSDD is the first synergistic sea-land segmentation dataset tailored for deep learning-based SAR ship detection, built upon the well-established SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD). It addresses the critical gap of lacking sea-land prior information in existing SAR ship detection datasets, enabling models to fully distinguish between sea and land regions for more accurate detection.

## üîç Core Features
- **Pixel-Level Sea-Land Annotations**: Each image is paired with a PNG-format segmentation mask (same filename as SSDD images) where pixel 0 denotes land and 255 denotes sea. Annotations are completed by SAR interpretation experts, ensuring precise coastal contours and offshore topography capture.
- **Seamless Compatibility**: Directly complements SSDD (1160 SAR images, 2456 ship targets from TerraSAR-X, RadarSat-2, Sentinel-1) without additional data modification, supporting both 8:2 train-test split and original SSDD experimental settings.
- **Dual Application Paradigms**:
  1. **Priors-Available Scenario**: Input both SAR images and sea-land masks to guide models (e.g., SLA-Net) in focusing on valuable sea/ship regions.
  2. **Priors-Unavailable Scenario**: Use masks as auxiliary labels to train sea-land segmentation capabilities (supervised/unsupervised) for subsequent ship detection.
- **Open & Reproducible**: Publicly accessible with standardized annotations, facilitating fair comparison and advancing research on synergy between sea-land segmentation and SAR ship detection.

## üöÄ Key Value
SL-SSDD effectively mitigates land-based false alarms (e.g., containers, coastal structures) and inshore ship missed detections by providing critical sea-land semantic priors. It empowers models to enhance feature extraction in sea regions, suppress land interference, and improve performance on small ships, nearshore complex scenes, and multiscale targets‚Äîaddressing long-standing challenges in SAR ship detection.
